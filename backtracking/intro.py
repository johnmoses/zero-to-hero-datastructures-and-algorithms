Back tracking

Write a simple backtracking algorithm
to solve the N-Queens problem.

The N-Queens problem is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard
such that no two queens can attack each other.
The goal is to find all possible solutions.

For example, with N = 4, there are 2 solutions:

[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
